Dispatcher & Alarm Menu for FiveM (QBCore Compatible) 🚓🚨
This dynamic Dispatcher and Alarm system for FiveM enhances roleplay for multiple police departments and banks, providing intuitive, location-based menus that integrate with ps-dispatch and ox_lib. Whether it’s sending urgent dispatches or triggering a silent bank alarm, this system ensures realism, control, and immersion. 🎯

🔹 Police Department Dispatch Menus
Each department (e.g., MRPD, Roxwood, Sandy, Paleto, etc.) gets its own custom dispatcher menu.

Dispatchers can send manual alerts with:

A location name

A reason for the call

A priority level

The alert automatically pulls coordinates from the player’s waypoint on the map. 📍

Alerts are tagged with the specific department name (e.g. “MRPD Dispatch Alert”), so responders know exactly where it's coming from.

🔹 Bank Alarm Confirmation System
Banks like Pacific Bank, Fleeca, Paleto, and Vangelico Jewelry have built-in hidden alarm spots.

Players are prompted with a confirmation menu before the silent alarm is sent.

Options: Send Alarm or Cancel

Prevents accidental alerts, giving the player full control.

Once confirmed, a custom dispatch alert is sent with the bank’s name and player’s location.
