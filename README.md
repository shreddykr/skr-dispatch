✨ Features

🔹 Police Department Dispatch Menus
Each department has its own custom menu (e.g. MRPD, Roxwood, Sandy, Paleto). Dispatchers can:

🔹 Type in a location name

🔹 Enter a reason for the alert

🔹 Set a priority level

🔹 The alert uses the dispatchers waypoint coordinates to automatically update the location of distress calls to all on duty PD 📍

🔹 Alerts are labeled (e.g. “MRPD Dispatch Alert”) so responders know the origin

🔹 Manual Dispatch Option
Send fully customized alerts anywhere on the map by placing a waypoint. Perfect for active dispatchers!

🔹 Bank Alarm Confirmation System
Banks like Pacific Standard, Fleeca, Paleto, and Vangelico Jewelry include hidden alarm triggers. Players are shown a confirmation dialog before dispatching an alert:

✅ Send Alarm

❌ Cancel

This avoids accidental callouts and keeps immersion high. Upon confirmation, a custom ps-dispatch alert is sent with the bank's name and coordinates.

🔹 Modern Text UI Integration
Stylish context menus and overlays powered by ox_lib. Player-friendly and visually consistent with top-tier roleplay servers.

🔹 New Code Upgrade
A text box replaces the default 99 label in ps-dispatch for cleaner, context-aware alerts.
