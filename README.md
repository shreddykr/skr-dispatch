Dispatcher Menu for FiveM (QBCore Compatible) 🚓🚨
This dynamic dispatcher menu for FiveM is designed to support multiple police departments with customizable locations, such as MRPD, Roxwood, and more! 🚔 Dispatchers can send manual dispatches that include a location name and reason for the call, with the option to automatically pull the current coordinates from a waypoint on the map. 📍

The menu adapts to each department based on their unique coordinates. When a player is near a department’s defined location (e.g., MRPD or Roxwood), the dispatcher menu is accessible, and the dispatch alerts are customized with the respective department's name. Each department gets its own custom alert title like "MRPD Dispatch Alert" or "Roxwood Dispatch Alert," making it clear where the call is coming from. 🛠️

Dependencies:

ox_lib: For context menus, UI prompts, and interaction zones.

ps-dispatch: For sending custom dispatch alerts with location and reason information.

With this system, dispatchers can quickly send relevant information to officers, ensuring that your server’s roleplay experience is enhanced and immersive. Perfect for customizing multiple police departments in your FiveM server! 🎮
